# Dotfiles

Config files for various applications I use across mac and linux

Has configurations for

* [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty): Terminal emulator written in rust. Mac and Linux have separate configurations.
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): terminal multiplexer. Probably the best thing in the world
* [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai): i3 replacement for macOS
* [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): framework for managing your Zsh configuration
