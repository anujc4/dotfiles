# To use this zshrc as your default zshrc file, create a symlink of this file
# in your home folder. Just create  a symlink of the zshrc file and it will
# source the other files on it's own. The command usually looks like
# ln -s ~/Personal/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc

# To profile zsh in case of slow startup, uncomment the line below and move the
# second command to the bottom of this file
# zmodload zsh/zprof
# zprof
